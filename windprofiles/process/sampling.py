    Merges multiple sets of data at a shared height, accounting
        for tower shadowing effects.
    `speeds` and `directions` should be the names of the columns of
        `df` containing the wind speeds and directions to combine.
    `angles` should be the center wind direction from which
        shadowing occurs for their respective boom (data set).
    `speeds`, `directions`, and `angles` must be iterables
        of the same length.
    At each time, if the wind direction reported by boom `i` is
        within width/2 of its corresponding shadowing angle,
        then its data will be considered shadowed and neither its
        speed or direction will be used. Data from all booms which
        are not shadowed will be (vector) averaged to form the
        resulting wind speed and direction at that time.
    Returns two columns: merged wind speeds and merged wind directions.
